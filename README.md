# This app is perfect for:

- Parents looking for a structured way to reinforce basic math.
- Teachers who want a quick math warm-up in class.
- Kids learning math independently in a supportive way.


# Future Improvements

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
-Use Tkinter or Pygame to turn the text-based version into a more visually engaging game.
-Add buttons for choices, input boxes for answers, and even animations or simple rewards.

2. Adaptive Difficulty
-Track user performance and adjust difficulty dynamically (e.g., increase range of numbers if accuracy is high).
-Could introduce a “level-up” system as they progress.

3. Scoring and Leaderboard
-Keep a score with bonuses for streaks.
-Add local (or online) leaderboard support using a JSON or text file for saving top scores.

4. User Profiles
-Let multiple users create profiles and store their progress.
-Save data to a file (like a .json) so they can come back and continue.

5. Achievements or Badges
Reward kids with badges like:

        “Perfect Round!”

        “5 in a row!”

        “Speedy Solver” (for fast answers)
